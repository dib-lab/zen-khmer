    "expensive.  This is largely because of combinatorics: for example,\n",

    "## Some basic traversal functions.\n",

    "khmer provides a technique called 'tagging', in which a subset of\n",
    "k-mers in the graph are chosen as representatives of the whole graph -\n",
    "and we choose these representatives so that *every* k-mer in the\n",
    "entire graph is within distance D of at least one representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "(khmer does this by using the reads as a guide into the graph;khmer\n",
    "makes sure that each read has a tag every D k-mers, and, since the\n",
    "graph is entirely constructed from reads, then the graph ends up being\n",
    "tagged at distance D as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tagging has a few nice features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* there are many fewer tags than there are k-mers (2D fold fewer,\n",
    "  approximately.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "* the structure and connectivity of the tags serves as a good proxy\n",
    "  for the connectivity of the overall graph; in this way they serve\n",
    "  as a sort of sparse graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* tags are somewhat refractory to coverage: highly covered regions will\n",
    "  get many fewer tags than the number of reads from that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "* tags provide a good entry point into the graph for traversal; in essense,\n",
    "  they provide waypoints for other work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* tags could, in theory, be used as an index into the reads. (@CTB expand.)\n",
